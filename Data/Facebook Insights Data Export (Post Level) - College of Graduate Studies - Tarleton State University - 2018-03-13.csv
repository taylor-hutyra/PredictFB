His family’s apartment overlooked a square that saw early fighting in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. He lost all of his family, except for his father, with whom Max was sent to forced labor camps. His father did not survive, and Max came to the U.S. in 1947 as an orphan. This is an opportunity that you will not want to miss, and the event is limited to the first 300 people.
